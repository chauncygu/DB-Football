This repo provides a simple, distributed and asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for the [Google Research Football](https://github.com/google-research/football) environment. Currently, it is **dedicated** for **Google Research Football** environment with the cooperative part implemented in **IPPO**/**MAPPO** and the competitive part implemented in **PSRO/Simple League**. In the future, we will also release codes for other related algorithms and environments.

Our codes are based on Light-MALib, which is a simplified version of [MALib](https://github.com/sjtu-marl/malib) with restricted algorithms and environments but certain enhancements, like distributed async-training, league-like multiple population training, detailed tensorboard logging. If you are also interested in other Multi-Agent Learning algorithms and environments, you may also refer to [MALib](https://github.com/sjtu-marl/malib) for more details.

## Install
You can use any tool to manage your python environment. Here, we use conda as an example.
1. install conda/minconda.
2. `conda create -n light-malib python==3.9` to create a new conda env.
3. activate the env by `conda activate light-malib` when you want to use it or you can add this line to your `.bashrc` file to enable it everytime you login into the bash.

### Install Light-MALib, PyTorch and Google Research Football
1. In the root folder of this repo (with the `setup.py` file), run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies of Light-MALib.
2. In the root folder of this repo (with the `setup.py` file), run `pip install .` or `pip install -e .` to install Light-MALib.
3. Follow the instructions in the official website https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to install PyTorch (for example, version 1.13.0+cu116).
4. Follow the instructions in the official repo https://github.com/google-research/football and install the Google Research Football environment.

### Add a New Football Game Scenario
1. You may use `python -c "import gfootball;print(gfootball.__file__)"` or other methods to locate where `gfootball` pacakage is. 
2. Go to the directory of `gfootball` pacakage, for example, `/home/username/miniconda3/envs/light-malib/lib/python3.8/site-packages/gfootball/`.
3. Copy `.py` files under `scenarios` folder in our repo to `scenarios` folder in the `gfootball` pacakage.

## Run Experiments
1. If you want to run experiments on a small cluster, please follow [ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/starting-ray.html)'s official instructions to start a cluster. For example, use `ray start --head` on the master, then connect other machines to the master following the hints from command line output.
2. `python light_malib/main_pbt.py --config <config_file_path>` to run a training experiment. An example is given by `train_light_malib.sh`.
3. `python light_malib/scripts/play_gr_football.py` to run a competition between two models. 

## Benchmark 11_vs_11 1.0 hard bot

<img src="imgs/compare_resource.svg" width="400px">

Beats 1.0 hard bot under multi-agent 11v11 full-game scenraios within 10 hours using IPPO, taking advantage of glitches in built-in logics.

## Google Reseach Football Toolkit
Currently, we provide the following tools for better study in the field of Football AI.
1. [Google Football Game Graph](light_malib/envs/gr_football/game_graph/): A data structure representing a game as a tree structure with branching indicating important events like goals or intercepts.

<img src='imgs/grf_data_structure.svg'>

2. [Google Football Game Debugger](light_malib/envs/gr_football/debugger/): A single-step graphical debugger illustrating both 3D and 2D frames with detailed frame data, such as the movements of players and the ball.

## Benchmark Policy
At this stage, we release some of our trained model for use as initializations or opponents. Model files are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OxdfsYUFRx-0q3VSbIMBoRsbkss_bHnK?usp=sharing) and [Baidu Wangpan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nCaz0QZb15_f1XGwVF-Uyw?pwd=nit1).
